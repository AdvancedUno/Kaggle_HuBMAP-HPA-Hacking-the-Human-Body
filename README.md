My goal is a ðŸ¥‰. If it goes well, ðŸ¥ˆ

trying pixel_size & np.float32/255 (segformer_b5)... 220829

trying stain h&e & out of mmseg & to scratch(segformer_b5)... 220830

i tried some augmentation about color because hpa & hubmap is diffent about color 
it is meaningful... 220830

i apply pixel_size augmentation but it be ineffective... 220903

about tiling... 220909
