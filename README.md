trying pixel_size & np.float32/255 (segformer_b5)... 220829

trying stain h&e & out of mmseg & to scratch(segformer_b5)... 220830

i tried some augmentation about color because hpa & hubmap is diffent about color 
it is meaningful... 220830

i apply pixel_size augmentation but it be ineffective... 220903

about tiling

i trying batch_size, loss fuction, augmentation... 220909

changed decoder-head to mixupsample... 220910

studying swa... 220913

train with coat... 220919

i train almost 48 hour two model

0.4 normalise and 0.7 normalise 

i got hubmap 0.58 hpa 0.21

My score 0.79++

i'm looking for hpa 22 or 23 model ... 220921
